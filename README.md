# Tower of Hanoi

The Tower of Hanoi (also called the Tower of Brahma or Lucas' Tower) was invented by the French mathematician Ã‰douard Lucas in 1883.

There is a story about an Indian temple which contains a large room with three old posts and 64 golden disks. Brahmin priests, acting out the command of an ancient prophecy, have been moving these disks for countless years. According to the legend, when the last move of the puzzle will be completed, the world will end!
